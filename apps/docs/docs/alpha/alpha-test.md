# RoC Alpha Test

## Welcome üéâ

Thank you for participating in the alpha test for React on Chain; an improved execution layer for NEAR's decentralized front-end components.

Significant effort has been dedicated to this project, reaching a stage where most of the essential features are established, laying the groundwork for the development of more sophisticated and refined applications. RoC is on the verge of achieving complete parity with the former VM, while also providing substantial additional functionalities.

That being said, this is an **alpha** so rough edges and bugs should be expected. We appreciate your help in identifying these issues so we can quickly move towards a stable release. üôè

:::danger Warning
Please use **non-vital NEAR accounts** during the alpha test since we have not yet initiated our security audit program. Avoid using accounts with significant balances, elevated permissions, or sentimental addresses.

## Timeline

RoC alpha test begins on Feb 26, 2024 and runs for several weeks as we perform rigorous testing both internally and with community members such as yourself. üôè

## How to get involved

    - [Test](#test) 
    - [Ask Questions & Get Support](#support) 
    - [Give Feedback](#give-feedback)

---

### Test

Using the [RoC Sandbox IDE](https://roc-sandbox.near.dev), try any of the following:

- Write components that aren't possible to build using the current VM
- Write components that test the limits of RoC
- Migrate your existing components from the VM to RoC
- Migrate vanilla React components to RoC
- Test npm package imports

:::tip npm Package Support
A wide variety of npm packages should work out of the box with RoC, especially non-UI packages. See the [npm section of our imports documentation](/alpha/building-decentralized-frontends/imports#npm) for full details.

**Note:** You can attempt to import any npm package, but not all will work due to the sand boxed environment. We are using this testing period to determine which packages will work and cataloging them in docs.

:::warning Not Supported Yet

    - `useRef` (refs not exposed to outer application)
    - `useContext`
    - `<canvas>` and other Web APIs
    - development with local code editor and bos-loader

:::

:::info Not Planned to be Supported
    - Direct DOM manipulation
    - Interoperability between RoC and the previous VM

We'd love to see what you build and hear about your experience! Please share what you build with us and the community! üôè
